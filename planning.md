#Toma Planning
Toma will be a tournament manager web application

Project specific features:
Users can create a tournment with a flexible variety of tournament types

Users can connect their account with one to three emails. (A user does not need an email to register, but tournaments with pre-set participants may require verified emails.)

Users can configure properties of the tournament, e.g. how it's scheduled, and whether rounds can occur concurrently

Users can list emails of members of the tournament.

Users can send emails for their tournament.

Users can link their verified account email to tournaments to customize their site

Users can install the web application as a progressive web app.

Users can provide constraints on tournament locations if the tournament is in-person

Users can query for the optimal structure and details of the tournament such as the type of tournament, what players play against whom given time constraints, and choosing locations based on constraints

Users can obtain a best-effort constraint satisfaction if not all constraints can be met.

General (foundational) Features:
Users can register and login to the application
