# Sprint Planning

Here I go over my plans for weekly sprints and log my progress throughout the weeks.

`Expected number of sprint weeks: 17` (1 planning week + ~4 months of development)

## Sprint 1 (September 14 - September 20)

### 1-Backlog

Planning:

1. Set up Trello with key user stories in upcoming sprints
2. Come up with the high level architecture of the application
3. Come up with requirements for the First Agile Iteration
4. Decide on the tools for this application

Learning:

- Nest.js
- Learn Auth0 and how to configure it with PostgreSQL
- Spin up Postgres in a Docker Container

### Week 1 Results

I've decided on some of the core features and architecture in the past week, but I hadn't succeeded in coming up with a detailed enough plan.

This upcoming week I'll have to start with the coding, but I can take some time each day to expand on my plans. The starting code won't be too rigid so it's fine for me to finalize my plans throughout this next week.

## Sprint 2 (September 21 - September 27)

### 2-Backlog

- Set up TypeORM migrations
- Iterate on planning for Agile Iteration
- Set up the Nest.js server
- Set up the React & Postgres frontend
- Set up session authentication
- Start design for Database Schema

### 2-Time Commitment Goals

`Projected time for this week: 10 hours`

### Week 2 Results

This week was poor in terms of time investment, due to other commitments getting in the way. This will likely be the case for Sprint 3 as well, and that means my first Agile Iteration will likely be pushed to sprint 4.

In this week, I modelled some of the database tables and begun setting up typeorm migrations. I haven't made it far on the backend authentication, and haven't started the frontend.

## Sprint 3 (September 28 - October 4)

### 3-Backlog

- Iterate on planning for Agile Iteration
- Iterate on design for Database Schema
- Set up the Nest.js server
- Set up the React & Postgres frontend
- Set up session authentication

### Week 3 Results

This week laid the groundwork for the database logic the rest of the project will be built upon. I set up some dto validation, but ultimately, I didn't end up finishing a single feature. I must admit that the Nest.js pattern is still one I haven't fully settled into, so I haven't been the most efficient.

I envision that I'll be able to spend more than double this amount of time in the upcoming week, as I have fewer commitments and have made some cuts to a few activities I dedicated time towards.

## Sprint 4 (October 5 to October 11)

### 4-backlog

- Finish up the authentication services
- Hook a React frontend to the application
- Add simplistic features for creating and joining tournaments

### Week 4 Results

I set up the core authentication aspects and started the tournament entity. The following week should begin the backend features for the First Agile Iteration.

## Sprint 5 (October 12 to October 18)

### 5-backlog

- Add backend services for basic tournaments
- Hook a frontend to the application

### Week 5 Results

Added some tournament relationships and mapped out the logic for the First Agile Iteration backend services. This upcoming week should finish the backend for the First Agile Iteration.
