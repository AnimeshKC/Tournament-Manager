# Sprint Planning

Here I go over my plans for weekly sprints and log my progress throughout the weeks.

`Expected number of sprint weeks: 17` (1 planning week + ~4 months of development)

## Sprint 1 (September 14 - September 20)

### 1-Backlog

Planning:

1. Set up Trello with key user stories in upcoming sprints
2. Come up with the high level architecture of the application
3. Come up with requirements for the First Agile Iteration
4. Decide on the tools for this application

Learning:

- Nest.js
- Learn Auth0 and how to configure it with PostgreSQL
- Spin up Postgres in a Docker Container

### 1-Time Commitment Goals

Projected time for this week: 7 hours

I aim to spend 10 hours a week on most weeks, but I'll ease in and be conservative for the first week.

I also have university classes and am working in a team project, so it would be hard to dedicate more than 10 hours weekly on this project.

### Week 1 Results

`Time Spent: 7.5 hours`

I've decided on some of the core features and architecture in the past week, but I hadn't succeeded in coming up with a detailed enough plan. I did meet my 7 hour goal, but some docker configuration aspects took me longer than I'd like.

This upcoming week I'll have to start with the coding, but I can take some time each day to expand on my plans. The starting code won't be too rigid so it's fine for me to finalize my plans throughout this next week.

## Sprint 2 (September 21 - September 27)

### 2-Backlog

- Set up TypeORM migrations
- Iterate on planning for Agile Iteration
- Set up the Nest.js server
- Set up the React & Postgres frontend
- Set up session authentication
- Start design for Database Schema

### 2-Time Commitment Goals

`Projected time for this week: 10 hours`

### Week 2 Results

`Time spend: 6.35 hours`

This week was poor in terms of time investment, due to other commitments getting in the way. This will likely be the case for Sprint 3 as well, and that means my first Agile Iteration will likely be pushed to sprint 4.

In this week, I modelled some of the database tables and begun setting up typeorm migrations. I haven't made it far on the backend authentication, and haven't started the frontend.

## Sprint 3 (September 28 - October 4)

### 3-Backlog

- Iterate on planning for Agile Iteration
- Iterate on design for Database Schema
- Set up the Nest.js server
- Set up the React & Postgres frontend
- Set up session authentication

### 3-Time Commitment Goals

`Projected time for this week: 7 hours`
