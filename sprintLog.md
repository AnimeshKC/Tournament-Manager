# Sprint Planning

Here I go over my plans for weekly sprints and log my progress throughout the weeks.
Expected number of sprint weeks: 17

## Sprint 1 (September 14 - September 20)

### Backlog

1. Create a Software Requirement Specification
2. Set up Trello with key user stories in upcoming sprints
3. Develop the core architecture of the application
4. Decide on the tools for this application
5. Learn the fundamentals of new technologies I'm using (Nest.js)

### Time Commitment Goals

Projected time for this week:

    Monday-Friday: ~45 minutes

    Saturday and Sundary: ~90 minutes

Time Allocation Plan (% of the week's time budget):

    Planning, Architecture, Setup: 60%

    Learning Nest.js: 40%

#### Time Considerations

7 hours a week is around the amount of time I can spend on the project, as I have university and I have several daily activites I engage in.

A group project I was part of (GoalTrack) is aiming to become a startup, and I'll be spending time on that project, which may cut my time for this project. Hopefully I can still reach the project time goal.
