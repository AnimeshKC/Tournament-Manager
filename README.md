# Welcome to Toma

This is _Toma_, a Tournament Management Application. Currently in the phase of developing the backend API.

See  my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/nsaFjtre/toma) for additional planning details.

## Local Setup Details

1. Install Postgres

2. In Postgres, create the database: `CREATE DATABASE toma`;

3. Create a `.env` file as per the [example](./toma-server/.env.example), where '${}' denotes arguments to be filled

4. While in the "toma-server" folder, install all dependencies with "npm install"
